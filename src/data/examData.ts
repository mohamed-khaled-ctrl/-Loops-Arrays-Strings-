  question: "What is the output of the following code?", 
  code: `int arr[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}; 
printf("%d", arr[2]);`, 
  language: "c", 
  options: [
    "1",
    "2",
    "3",
    "5"
  ], 
  correctAnswer: 2,

  question: "Which loop is guaranteed to execute at least once?", 
  code: ``, 
  language: ``, 
  options: [
    "for",
    "while",
    "do-while",
    "None"
  ],
